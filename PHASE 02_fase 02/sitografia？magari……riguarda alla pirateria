One thing, sorry I don’t know how to find the article in English about this, maybe 10 years ago, during about 2000-2012, 
chinese people could download everything free through the Internet — movies, musics, manga, animations, also the vediogames — 
of course all of them are pirated, especially those foreignal, because the government was very serious about checking the import of the
cultural media (they had forbided the vedio game consoles for 10 years! Because some fuck stupid parents told to the government 
that vediogames will make terrible influence to their childrens!! We only could play the game on PC, or downloaded the pirated game 
which was translated by fun subtitled groups, bought the game consoles from HK or other countries or used the emulatore, damn it#####). 
So some people tried to get the raw and translated it, then uploaded these resources on websites so that everyone could get them free.
Because of this, Chinese have had poor consciousness about coptright untile these years, because now these foreignal companys have been 
focing on thier copyright and the government become more relaxed about checking, so some sites begin to buy the authorization. 
But the authorization is only given to the China, and you know the mainland China has the Great Firewall, so, when you aren’t in China, 
without a chinese IP, you can’t visit the site which has authorizations of some vedios/manga/musics……
So now there is a situation like this ↓……

【Douji】
For me this term is interesting， because people can get commercial profits without the author's allowance.
（I also have the experience to make the Doujishi）
